# quizzer

To use this, you will need a file named `questions.txt` located in the same folder as the executable file.  Here is what the questions file should look like:

```
question 1,answer 1
question 2,answer 2
question 3,answer 3
...
```

To use the quizzer, compile the `quizzer.cpp` file to an executable file and run the executable file from the command line.  The answers must be entered exactly to be counted as correct, and they are case sensitive.  Each time you get one wrong it will increase the number of times you have to get that question correct before you win.

I made this in my first semester at Missouri S&T, while I was taking [CS1570 with Clayton Price](https://sites.google.com/a/mst.edu/price/courses/cs-1570).  I made this to help me study for my classes.
